## gm, we're Talent Protocol ðŸ‘‹

We are a web3 professional community and platform for high-potential builders where they can build their verifiable on-chain resume and find the support they need to succeed.

Talent Protocol is rooted in two core beliefs:

1. Openness and transparency are better for the world,
2. Communities over individuals, because no one succeeds alone.

This is why we're **fully open-source**, **building in public**, and on a path to **progressive decentralization**. Explore more about our [Community](https://www.notion.so/Community-b4e71d89e1d348aca321f22a40905e94).

### ðŸ’« The Community for the Builders of Tomorrow.

### ðŸ§­ Our Mission

Helping the next generation of talented builders achieve success. 
<details> 
	<summary>From single player and zero-sum game...</summary>
	<br>
	Careers are still a single player and zero-sum game where background matters more than merit. As a result, weâ€™re missing out on a lot of high-potential builders.
</details>

	<summary>...to a multiplayer professional journey!</summary>
	<br>
	Careers should be a game where all players are rewarded for the role they play in collective success. A levelled playing field where careers are composable, connections are meaningful and success is shared because no one achieves their full potential alone.

### ðŸ”­ Vision

We see a world where talent has **full control over their careers**. A new reality where technology unlocks powerful connections and accelerates professional growth.

<details> 
	<summary>Talent is abundant.</summary>
	<br>
  Contrary to popular belief, talent is not scarce.

  The biggest issue is that opportunities are not equally distributed.

<details> 
	<summary>Communities accelerate career growth.</summary>
	<br>
  The 1st era of the web was about how we interact with information. Google won this era. The 2nd era was about how we interact with each other, thus Facebook was born. The 3rd era is about how we interact and exchange value with each other. 

  Instead of just following someone on Twitter, weâ€™ll hold their tokens to become economically, emotionally and socially invested in each othersâ€™ journeys.

  Everyone should be able to create their own career circles and personal economies.
</details>
<details> 
	<summary>Career ownership becomes collective.</summary>
	<br>
  The work economy hasnâ€™t changed that much since the industrial age. Revenue still flows from Employers to Employees regardless if youâ€™re a contractor or permanent employee.

  We believe in a society where collective career ownership becomes as relevant as revenue flows.
